# LibP2P seed for JVM
###### [**learn more about concept of a seed**](https://github.com/LeoTheDarvin/ForLibP2PCommunity/blob/root/proposals.md#early-decoupling)
## What should be added here?
Just a minimum of essentials for developer-community-wide acceptance declarations and contracts.</br>
Compliance to interfaces of **seed** must become sufficient to integrate an implementation with entire LibP2P.

## How to achieve common acceptance?
Shortly - it's impossible. But wide acceptance is achievable and must be taken for priority within seed. 
Here's an approach to [manage Acceptance Rating](https://github.com/LeoTheDarvin/ForLibP2PCommunity/blob/root/proposals.md#git-branch-based-conflicts-negotiation-and-acceptance-rating)

## Considerations for implementors
###### Content of the topic is highly disputable inherently. Think critically and consider AR taking something of here as a contract
- keep compatibility with both Android and OpenJDK


## Understanding of architecture
### Basic principles
#### Indirect access
### Modules
### Components
### Resources
### Protocol handlers
### Approach to multithreading
#### Single-threaded core
#### Asynchronous components
#### Synchronization points

## How to?
###### This section is aimed to narrow a learning curve for individuals who want to implement a custom module.
### Implement a module
### Implement a transport
### Implement an upgrade protocol
### Implement a multiplexer
### Implement an application protocol
### Implement a traffic relay
### Embed NAT-traversal
### Embed system of control over traffic and malicious behavior

## Attachment
#### Compatibility with android
###### TODO: make a complete guide, please
- Android supports native features up to Java 7. Kotlin is supported completely
